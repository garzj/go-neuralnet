# go-neuralnet

A small neural network written in Go created to classify images from the [mnist database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Why?

I was ill and wanted to learn a bit about neural networks, so I watched [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w) [epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8) from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). Then I wrote my own implementation as an exercise.

**Note:** Please don't use this network. It's badly optimized and does barely work.

## Run the project

```
go run main.go
```
